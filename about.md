Hi! I'm Nathan. I created this blog to document my adventures as an IT enthusiast. You will find articles about my homelab, the things I learn about in school, my labs to train for certifications (CCNA...), etc.

I mainly started this to document what I'm doing and show it to recruiters, but if I can encourage people to get into IT, self hosting and DIY then it would be a great success.

*Thank You for reading!*
